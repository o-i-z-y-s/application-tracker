# application-tracker

## What is this?
A small tool I made for tracking job applications. Managing a spreadsheet is tiring and most existing tools for this are bloated and require an account.

## Steps
1. Create a new tracker!
2. Make your changes!
3. Download your tracker as a CSV!

Upload your CSV to pick up where you left off. Make sure to download it again if you've edited it.
