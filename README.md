# job-application-tracker

## What is this?
A small tool I made for tracking job applications. Managing a spreadsheet is tiring and most existing tools for this are bloated and require an account.

## Steps
1. Create a new tracker!
2. Make your changes!
3. Save your tracker in-browser or download it as a CSV!

Load from your cookies or upload your CSV to pick up where you left off. Make sure to save/download again if you've edited it.
